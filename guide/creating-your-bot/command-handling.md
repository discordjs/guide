# Command handling

Unless your bot project is small, it's not a very good idea to have a single file with a giant `if`/`else if` chain for commands. If you want to implement features into your bot and make your development process a lot less painful, you'll want to implement a command handler. Let's get started on that!

::: tip
For fully functional slash commands, there are three important pieces of code that need to be written. They are:

1. The [individual command files](slash-commands), containing their definitions and functionality.
2. The command handler, which dynamically reads the files and executes the commands.
3. The [command deployment script](command-deployment), to register your slash commands with Discord so they appear in the interface.

These steps can be done in any order, but **all are required** before the commands are fully functional.

This page details how to complete **Step 2**. Make sure to also complete the other pages linked above!

## Loading command files

Now that your command files have been created, your bot needs to load these files on startup. 

In your `index.js` or `index.ts` file, make these additions to the base template:

::::: typescript-tip
TypeScript will not let you attach a `commands` property to your client instance without some work. We'll need to extend the base `Client` class and create our own `ExtendedClient` class with the additional properties we need.

Add the following file:
:::: code-group
::: code-group-item src/structures/ExtendedClient.ts
```ts
import { Client, ClientOptions, Collection } from 'discord.js';
import { SlashCommand } from '../types/SlashCommand';

export class ExtendedClient extends Client {
    constructor(options: ClientOptions, public commands: Collection<string, SlashCommand> = new Collection()) {
        super(options);
    }
}
```

This class can be instantiated just like the `Client` class, except it also accepts a second `commands` parameter. This parameter will default to an empty `Collection` if nothing is passed as an argument.

:::::

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item js
```js {1-3,8}
const fs = require('node:fs');
const path = require('node:path');
const { Client, Collection, Events, GatewayIntentBits } = require('discord.js');
const { token } = require('./config.json');

const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });

client.commands = new Collection();
```
:::
:::code-group-item ts
```ts {1-2}
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import { Client, Events, GatewayIntentBits } from 'discord.js';
import { ExtendedClient } from './structures/ExtendedClient';
import { Config, assertObjectIsConfig } from './types/Config';

// Read the config file
const configRaw = fs.readFileSync('../config.json', { encoding: 'utf-8' });
const config = JSON.parse(configRaw);

assertObjectIsConfig(config);


const { token } = config;

// ExtendedClient's second `commands` parameter defaults to an empty Collection
const client = new ExtendedClient({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });
```
:::
::::

We recommend attaching a `.commands` property to your client instance so that you can access your commands in other files. The rest of the examples in this guide will follow this convention. 

::: tip
- The [`fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) module is Node's native file system module. `fs` is used to read the `commands` directory and identify our command files.
- The [`path`](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) module is Node's native path utility module. `path` helps construct paths to access files and directories. One of the advantages of the `path` module is that it automatically detects the operating system and uses the appropriate joiners.
- The <DocsLink section="collection" path="Collection:Class" /> class extends JavaScript's native [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) class, and includes more extensive, useful functionality. `Collection` is used to store and efficiently retrieve commands for execution.
:::

Next, using the modules imported above, dynamically retrieve your command files with a few more additions to the `index.js` file:

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item js
```js {3-19}
client.commands = new Collection();

const foldersPath = path.join(__dirname, 'commands');
const commandFolders = fs.readdirSync(foldersPath);

for (const folder of commandFolders) {
	const commandsPath = path.join(foldersPath, folder);
	const commandFiles = fs.readdirSync(commandsPath).filter(file => file.endsWith('.js'));
	for (const file of commandFiles) {
		const filePath = path.join(commandsPath, file);
		const command = require(filePath);
		// Set a new item in the Collection with the key as the command name and the value as the exported module
		if ('data' in command && 'execute' in command) {
			client.commands.set(command.data.name, command);
		} else {
			console.log(`[WARNING] The command at ${filePath} is missing a required "data" or "execute" property.`);
		}
	}
}
```
:::
::: code-group-item ts
```ts {3-19}
const foldersPath = path.join(__dirname, '../build/commands');
const commandFolders = fs.readdirSync(foldersPath);

for (const folder of commandFolders) {
	const commandsPath = path.join(foldersPath, folder);
	const commandFiles = fs.readdirSync(commandsPath).filter(file => file.endsWith('.js'));
	for (const file of commandFiles) {
		const filePath = path.join(commandsPath, file);
		import(filePath).then(module => {
            const command = module.default;
            // Set a new item in the Collection with the key as the command name and the value as the exported module
            if ('data' in command && 'execute' in command) {
                client.commands.set(command.data.name, command);
            } else {
                console.log(`[WARNING] The command at ${filePath} is missing a required "data" or "execute" property.`);
            }
        });
	}
}

```

::: typescript-tip
The code above may require slight modifications depending on your `tsconfig.json`. In particular, if the `module` option is changed from the default `commonjs` value to one of the ESM values, you will need to change the `filePath` inside the `import()` call, as ESM does not support importing modules from absolute paths without a `file:///` prefix. You will also need to use `import.meta.dirname` instead of `__dirname`. Your mileage may vary!
:::

First, [`path.join()`](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) helps to construct a path to the `commands` directory. The first [`fs.readdirSync()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readdirsync_path_options) method then reads the path to the directory and returns an array of all the folder names it contains, currently `['utility']`. The second `fs.readdirSync()` method reads the path to this directory and returns an array of all the file names they contain, currently `['ping.js', 'server.js', 'user.js']`. To ensure only command files get processed, `Array.filter()` removes any non-JavaScript files from the array.

With the correct files identified, the last step is dynamically set each command into the `client.commands` Collection. For each file being loaded, check that it has at least the `data` and `execute` properties. This helps to prevent errors resulting from loading empty, unfinished, or otherwise incorrect command files while you're still developing.

## Receiving command interactions

You will receive an interaction for every slash command executed. To respond to a command, you need to create a listener for the <DocsLink path="Client:Class#interactionCreate" /> event that will execute code when your application receives an interaction. Place the code below in the `index.js` file you created earlier.

```js
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, interaction => {
	console.log(interaction);
});
```

Not every interaction is a slash command (e.g. `MessageComponent` interactions). Make sure to only handle slash commands in this function by making use of the <DocsLink path="BaseInteraction:Class#isChatInputCommand" type="method"/> method to exit the handler if another type is encountered. This method also provides typeguarding for TypeScript users, narrowing the type from `BaseInteraction` to <DocsLink path="ChatInputCommandInteraction:Class" />.

```js {2}
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, interaction => {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;
	console.log(interaction);
});
```

## Executing commands

When your bot receives a <DocsLink path="Client:Class#interactionCreate" /> event, the interaction object contains all the information you need to dynamically retrieve and execute your commands!

Let's take a look at the `ping` command again. Note the `execute()` function that will reply to the interaction with "Pong!".

```js
module.exports = {
	data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
		.setName('ping')
		.setDescription('Replies with Pong!'),
	async execute(interaction) {
		await interaction.reply('Pong!');
	},
};
```

First, you need to get the matching command from the `client.commands` Collection based on the `interaction.commandName`. Your <DocsLink path="Client:Class"/> instance is always available via `interaction.client`. If no matching command is found, log an error to the console and ignore the event.

With the right command identified, all that's left to do is call the command's `.execute()` method and pass in the `interaction` variable as its argument. In case something goes wrong, catch and log any error to the console.

```js {1,4-20}
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, async interaction => {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;

	const command = interaction.client.commands.get(interaction.commandName);

	if (!command) {
		console.error(`No command matching ${interaction.commandName} was found.`);
		return;
	}

	try {
		await command.execute(interaction);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
		if (interaction.replied || interaction.deferred) {
			await interaction.followUp({ content: 'There was an error while executing this command!', ephemeral: true });
		} else {
			await interaction.reply({ content: 'There was an error while executing this command!', ephemeral: true });
		}
	}
});
```

#### Next steps

Your command files are now loaded into your bot, and the event listener is prepared and ready to respond. In the next section, we cover the final step: a command deployment script you'll need to register your commands so they appear in the Discord client.
